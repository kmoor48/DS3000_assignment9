        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will use various transformer models for semantic search and for language generation. We will be using the `transformers` python package from huggingface; **note** that this package will automatically download language models as required the first time the code is run, and they can be quite large. (The entire assignment might download a few GB.) You might want to do this on campus, depending on your internet situation.\n",

        "To learn about how generative language models can be used in practice, focusing on GPT-2, which is feasible to run locally without a graphics card.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Write a script that generates a \"story\" using a local GPT-2 model. Your story should: 1) be at least 100 words long; 2) not have repeated phrases; and 3) be the same every time your script is run. It might be nonsensical and/or hilarious. Use the skeleton code provided below as a starting point, and <https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate> as a reference document.\n",

He runs his steps into a tall four-block high wall in the middle of the alley with both men and women smoking cigarettes. The vendors open a tiny alley; everyone tastes an echidna and wears their hair. His mood changes from rock 'n' roll trap to social fad to something colder. \"Awake, man, I want to see my party,\" the few people. They all join one another in the alley and stay with the waiting crowd. One day he starts wondering if his encounter with the monolith that's been blocking his road is his last as an alternate human, ready to join the fight. Maybe it's the trick of his game that's coming down upon him. Then he looks up and sees his pale, tip-toed girlfriend in black hoodie who grins and cowers in front of him. \"I need you to tell me why I'm so big,\" he asks. She laughs, but then looks away.\n\n\n\"Empire's Fair?\"\n\n\nShe's grimacing as she walks out of the alleyway.\n\n\nThe curious group meets up with a gang of pals waiting tables for an ATM.
